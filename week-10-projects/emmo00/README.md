# LandRegistry

Blockchain-powered verification system that ensures transparent, tamper-proof records of land ownership.

## The Problem

Land ownership disputes are way too common — especially in regions where records are handwritten, scattered across multiple offices, or worse, mysteriously “missing.”

People lose properties, get scammed, or spend years in court because a piece of paper said one thing, and some government staff or “land agent” said another.

The lack of a reliable, tamper-proof record system means trust is low, fraud is high, and verification is expensive, slow, and largely opaque.

## The solution

LandRegistry stores land ownership records directly on the blockchain — publicly verifiable, immutable, and timestamped.

Here’s what it offers:

- Tamper-proof verification: Once a record is written, not even I can alter it. And that’s the whole point.

- Open ownership: Every change in ownership is logged and visible. No shady backdoor deals.

- Decentralized access: You don’t need to know someone in the ministry to verify or register land — you just need a wallet.

- Cost-effective and secure: Cuts out intermediaries and reduces paperwork. No more photocopying a "C of O" ten times.

At its core, the project isn’t just about digitizing land ownership — it’s about restoring trust where it’s been broken for decades.
